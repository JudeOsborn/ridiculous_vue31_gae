# Ridiculously Simple Vue + App Engine

Absolutely the simplest Vue + App Engine web app I could imagine. 

No backend. Everything goes through the .yaml file. 

Static files go in the /static folder. Nothing but a favicon.

Vue loaded via CDN.

## Instructions

Edit deploy.sh so it points to your app engine id (replace [app id]).

Run deploy.sh to deploy to your app engine instance of choice.

Run dev_server.sh to run a local server hosted at localhost:8080 by default.

## Why did I do this?

This is part of a series of ridiculously simple, executable code examples. 

Sometimes we need to cut through the documentation jungle and get to making stuff.
